Git is a version control system that helps track changes to files and collaborate on projects efficiently. It allows multiple people to work on the same codebase simultaneously without conflicts. Git stores a complete history of changes, allowing users to revert to previous versions, branch out for experimental work, and merge changes seamlessly.

"git init" initializes a new Git repository in a directory.
"git clone" copies a repository from a remote source to your local machine.
"git add" adds files to the staging area to be committed.
"git commit" records changes to the repository with a descriptive message.
"git push" sends committed changes to a remote repository.
"git pull" fetches and merges changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
"git status" displays status or changes.
